          </div>
          <h3>Location information</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">Our Service is also about sharing location and finding friends and others nearby, so we will use your location information to provide the basic functionality of the Service, such as displaying your location on the Services map to other users when you check-in using Third Party Services (social networks) or your specifically “on” in the application.

          </div>
          <h3>Information Collected via Technology</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">
            As you use Yoin Services, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your IP address, browser type and operating system. We may also use cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (”URLs”) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Yoin Platform you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Yoin Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Yoin Services to meet your special interests and needs.
            <br/>
            For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access the Yoin Platform to assist with ad targeting. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.
          </div>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">
            “Cookies” are small pieces of information that Yoin sends to and stores on the Device that you use when accessing the Yoin Platform.
            <br/>
            Yoin uses cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Yoin Platform and to improve Yoin Services. Cookies help us evaluate what types of information that might be of interest to you and other users, to improve our and our Merchants’ advertisements and to protect you and Yoin from unlawful activities. We also use cookies to know when you are interacting with Merchants or other third parties.
            <br/>
            In order to use Yoin Services, your Device must accept cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following your Internet browser´s help file directions. But some aspects of the Yoin Platform may not work properly and you may not be able to use Yoin Services if our cookies are removed or blocked.
          </div>
        <h2>7. Use and Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            Personal Data that you submit to us is used by Yoin to provide you with access to the Yoin Platform and Yoin Services; to administer your Yoin Account; to improve Yoin Services; to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Yoin Platform; and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us (including in cases when we contact you in connection with specific Merchant opportunities and promotions).
            <br/>
            Yoin may provide your Personal Data to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the Yoin Platform and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments) and providing customer service. Such third-party service providers may only process Personal Data to provide the relevant services to Yoin and in accordance with Yoin’s instructions.
            <br/>
            The Personal Data that you provide will allow Yoin to inform you of Yoin Services, such as available gifts as well as other services and products that may be of interest to you. Yoin may use your Personal Data for processing, managing and providing you with retail offers, advertisements and other information related to your profile and interests. By using Yoin Services you agree that Yoin may contact you to conduct targeted advertising based on the information provided by you and collected by Yoin. This type of targeting is performed to make Yoin Services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with the Yoin Platform to meet your special interests and needs. Sometimes this type of targeting and other offers, advertisements and promotions is performed by Yoin on behalf of Merchants. Yoin does not disclose your Personal Data to Merchants, but may make certain of your non-personally identifiable demographic information (like age, gender and general location) available in connection with our agreements with Merchants. None of the information provided to Merchants would allow them to identify you or your Personal Data.
            <br/>
            We may promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Yoin Platform on behalf of Merchants and ad servers. These Merchants may use cookies and/ or “Web Beacons” (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of such Merchants. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any such Merchants, as further described in Section 7 (Third-Party Websites) in the Terms of Service.
            <br/>
            Your Personal Data may also form part of Yoin’s statistics but then we will exclude, for instance, your name. Yoin will generally aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Yoin Services and to help Merchants indirectly (via Yoin) target users with the desired demographics. In addition to the above, Yoin may disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Yoin or pursuant to any other legal claims or (b) to protect and defend Yoin’s rights, property or interests or (c) to protect your rights or any third-party rights or (d) fight against fraud or (e) to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service).
          </div>
        <h2>8. Ability to View Your Information</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            When you register a Yoin Account, your Social Network friends will be notified of your use of Yoin Services. Your Social Network friends with Yoin accounts will then be able to give you electronic gifts provided by various Merchants.
            <br/>
            It is up to you to make sure that you are comfortable with the information that you choose to provide to Yoin and the information you choose to publish either directly on the Yoin Platform or through your Social Network, which is connected to the Yoin Platform.
            <br/>
            You acknowledge that when you use Yoin Services, certain information that you post or provide through the Yoin Platform (such as your name, profile, comments, collections and reviews,) may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of the Yoin Platform, including, without limitation, social media applications and other public fora (plural for forums ☺) in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Data when posting comments or other information or content through the Yoin Platform, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the Yoin Platform. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post via the Yoin Platform and make available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out Personal Data to others through Social Networks.

          </div>
        <h2>10. Access to, Rectifying and Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">

            <br/>
            Yoin will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate a request to delete Personal Data, unless such data is required to be retained pursuant to applicable laws, or for lawful business purposes, or to protect and defend Yoin’s rights, property or interests, or to fight against fraud, or to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service).

        <div class="legal-content">By placing an order for a given Gift, you agree to purchase the Gift you have selected on the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with Gift.

Once the purchase is confirmed the Gift will be sent to the selected friend using YoinUp’s platform. You are required to register an account with YoinUp in order to purchase or redeem any Gift. An account is required so we can collect information to allow you to pay for your Gift and provide you with easy access to your friends list, view your past purchases, and modify your preferences.</div>

        <div class="legal-content">The Merchant is obligated to honor the Gift in compliance with law. If the Merchant refuses to honor the Gift before the legally permitted expiration date, then YoinUp will refund the amount of the paid Gift in the form of a credit for future gift promotions.
